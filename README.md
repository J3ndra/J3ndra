<h1 align="center">Halo, I'm Junianto ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a 7th-semester student at Udinus, passionate about technology, machine learning, and software development. Currently, I'm diving deep into Python for machine learning, including frameworks like TensorFlow, and exploring CI/CD practices for machine learning workflows.</h3>

<h2 align="left">ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning</h2>

- **Machine Learning**: Working with TensorFlow to build and train models.
- **CI/CD for ML**: Setting up pipelines to automate machine learning workflows.
- **Python Development**: Continually improving my Python skills for building efficient, scalable applications.

<h2 align="left">ðŸ’¼ Projects</h2>

- **FastAPI ML Pipeline**
    I'm currently working on a FastAPI project that incorporates various tools and technologies to build a robust machine learning pipeline:
    - FastAPI: Backend development for API services.
    - DVC (Data Version Control): Managing datasets, models, and experiment tracking.
    - MLflow: Model training, versioning, and deployment.
    - Prefect: Workflow automation and orchestration.
    - Evidently AI: Model performance monitoring and analysis.
    - Grafana: Visualization and monitoring of metrics and system performance.
    - Vue.js: Building a user-friendly frontend for interacting with the APIs and monitoring dashboards.
